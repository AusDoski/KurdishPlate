        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Making eggs over easy at home ensures you get an egg cooked just the way you like it. Over easy eggs are fried eggs that are flipped over to cook the top and envelope the yolk in egg white. The whites should be firm, while the unbroken yolk remains runny. The two most important things in the recipe are the eggs and the pan; whenever possible, choose fresh free-range, pasture-raised, or organic eggs, and make sure to pick a good quality nonstick skillet. Serve over easy eggs on buttered toast or alongside crispy home fries, with a side of bacon and grilled tomato.</p>
        <h2>ingredients</h2>

                <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
