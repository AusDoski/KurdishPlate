        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sheet pan eggs are a quick and easy way to cook a lot of eggs at once. The results are similar to a frittata or a thick omelet, making them especially good for piling on bagels or toast. There are a few big pluses to baking eggs in the oven: there's minimal prep, you don't have to stand around to watch them cook, they can feed a crowd, take care of your meal prep for the week, and they're versatile.</p>
        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking spray or vegetable oil/butter to grease pan</li>
            <li>18 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk , or non-dairy alternative</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese , or shredded cheese of your choice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup bell pepper, diced small</li>
            <li>1/4 cup onion, diced small</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 F. Use cooking spray to generously grease a rimmed half sheet pan, approximately 18-x 13-inches.

                In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper. Beat with a whisk until all of the eggs are broken up and the mixture is a uniform yellow color.</li>
            <li>Carefully pour the egg mixture into the prepared sheet pan. If using, sprinkle the cheese over top followed by the peppers and onions.</li>
            <li>Bake just until the eggs are cooked through in the center, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let cool for a few minutes in the pan. Use a sharp knife to cut into 12 squares. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
